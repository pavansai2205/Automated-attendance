/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AttendX.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.
 * User access is determined by their assigned role and the permissions associated with that role.
 * Ownership is enforced where applicable, such as on `/users/{userId}` and `/courses/{courseId}`.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles; path-based ownership.
 * - /roles/{roleId}: Stores role definitions for RBAC.
 * - /permissions/{permissionId}: Stores permission definitions.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course information; `instructorId` denotes ownership.
 * - /courses/{courseId}/classSessions/{classSessionId}: Stores class sessions, nested under courses.
 * - /attendanceRecords/{attendanceRecordId}: Stores attendance records for all students.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is restricted to instructors only.
 * - Roles and Permissions collections are only writable by a user with the 'admin' role.
 * - Students can create their own attendance records, but cannot modify or delete them.
 * - Instructors can view attendance records for their courses.
